### Getting started for Development

There are two methods for getting started with this repo.

#### Familiar with Git?

```
  > git clone git@github.com:chintan9/plyr-react.git
  > cd plyr-react
  > npm run install
```

#### Not Familiar with Git?

Click [here](https://github.com/chintan9/plyr-react.git/archive/master.zip) to
download the .zip file. Extract the contents of the zip file, then open your
terminal, change to the project directory, and:

```
  > npm run install
```

#### Developing

To start the developing run :

```
> npm run dev
```

This will build a version of your library, run the watcher and also run the
Styleguide. To open the Styleguide manualy open your Browser and navigate to
[http://localhost:6060](http://localhost:6060). Start developing your components
in `src/lib/components` folder and update the `src/lib/index.js` file
accordingly. Always provide an `YourComponent.examples.md` file, so your
component will show up in the Styleguide. You can refer to example
`Plyr` component, but i think you'll get the idea.

##### Proposals (Babel)

For smoother development some Babel plugin are included

- [class-properties](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-plugin-proposal-class-properties)
- [object-rest-spread](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread)
- [optional-chaining](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-plugin-proposal-optional-chaining)

##### Styling your components

`SCSS` and `CSS` are supported out of the box just import your styles into your
component like you normally would do. For the use of `CSS Modules` refer to
[rollup-plugin-postcss](https://github.com/egoist/rollup-plugin-postcss)

##### Testing

Testing is done with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/),
[Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) and
[Jasmine Matchers](https://github.com/JamieMason/Jasmine-Matchers) You can refer
to `Plyr.test.js` as an example.

```
> npm run test
```

or (for getting coverage)

```
> npm run test:coverage
```

##### Linting

Linting is set up through [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and configured with
[eslint-config-airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) You
can modify linting rules by overriding them in the `.eslintrc.json` file.

```
> npm run lint
```

or (for for automatic fixing if possible)

```
> npm run lint:fix
```

##### Publishing your library to NPM

To release your library to NPM or your private Registry, make sure you have an
active account at [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), your `.npmrc` file is correctly
setup and the repository url in `package.json` file is set to your repository
url, then:

```
> npm run release
```

##### Styleguide

For custom layouts, styling and more information about the Styleguide please
refer to [React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/) documentation.

##### Deploy the Styleguide to GitHub Pages

Make sure the repository url in `package.json` file is set to your repository
url, then:

```
> npm run deploy
```

##### Scripts

- `npm run dev` : Executes the develop mode, running watcher and the Styleguide,
  rebuilding your library on every change.
- `npm run start` : Only serves the Styleguide.
- `npm run build` : Builds your library (build can be found in `dist` folder).
- `npm run styleguide:build` : Builds the static Styleguide in case you want to
  deploy it.
- `npm run test` : Runs the tests.
- `npm run test:coverage`: Runs the test and shows the coverage.
- `npm run lint` : Runs the linter.
- `npm run lint:fix` : Runs the linter and fixes automatic fixable issues.
- `npm run release` : Publishes your Library on NPM or your private Registry
  (depending on your config in your `.npmrc` file).
- `npm run deploy`: Deploys the Styleguide to GitHub Pages.
